We prepared for you 5,000 Ukrainian Postal Marks, which will save the memory about bravest soldiers you have ever seen, the Ukrainian Soldiers. 

Our team, as well as, all Ukraine were extremely inspired by heroic defense of Snake Island by Ukrainian Soldiers, who declined the order of Russian warship to surrender and replied “Russian warship, go fuck yourself”. 

Ukrainian government released a postage stamp honoring the soldiers on Snake Island and author of this masterpiece is Ukrainian artist Boris Groh. 

We would like to save this legacy forever.
